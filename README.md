# Northwind SQL Analytics

This repository provides SQL scripts and analysis to extract insights from the Northwind Traders sample database. We leverage techniques like window functions and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to complete tasks based on business needs.

We work with a version of Northwind that has been adapted for PostgreSQL, which can be found on [this GitHub page](https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql/tree/master).
